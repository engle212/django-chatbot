Unlike his brethren who loved to illuminate the night sky with their dazzling displays, Flicker was afraid of the dark. \n\nEvery night, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Flicker would burrow deep into the leaves of a giant oak tree, his light dimmed to a mere flicker. He longed to join the other fireflies, to dance and twirl amongst the stars, but fear held him captive.\n\nOne night, a wise old owl named Celeste noticed Flicker's trembling light. She hooted softly, \"Little one, why do you hide your brilliance?\"\n\nFlicker confessed his fear, his voice barely a whisper. Celeste listened patiently, then said, \"Fear is a shadow, Flicker. It only grows stronger when you hide from it. Embrace the darkness, and you'll find your own light shines even brighter.\"\n\nFlicker hesitated, but Celeste's words resonated within him. Taking a deep breath, he emerged from the leaves. The city lights seemed to mock him, the darkness vast and intimidating. But then, he remembered Celeste's words. He focused on his own light, letting it grow stronger, brighter.\n\nAs he flew, he saw other fireflies, their lights painting the night sky with wonder. He joined them, his fear melting away with each beat of his wings. He realized that the darkness wasn't something to be feared, but a canvas upon which his light could shine.\n\nFrom that night on, Flicker became known as the bravest firefly in the city. He learned that true courage wasn't the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it and shine your light even brighter.\n\n\n\n"], [0, "hello"], [1, "Hello! \ud83d\udc4b  \n\nIt's nice to hear from you again.
